## üìå Introduction & Objective

In this project, I created a live honeynet to lure attackers into a vulnerable Azure environment. This involved deploying unsecured virtual machines to the public internet. To collect and analyze telemetry, I configured a **Log Analytics Workspace**, and integrated **Microsoft Sentinel** to generate attack maps, alerts, and incidents.

Microsoft Sentinel monitored the environment for 24 hours, after which I implemented security controls and re-ran monitoring for another 24 hours. The goal was to demonstrate the impact of controls (mapped to **NIST 800-53**) and show how to apply **incident response strategies (NIST 800-61)** while analyzing attacker behavior through logs and alerts.

- Azure Virtual Network (VNet)
- Azure Network Security Groups (NSG)
- Virtual Machines (2x Windows, 1x Linux)
- Log Analytics Workspace (KQL)
- Azure Key Vault (private endpoints)
- Azure Storage Account
- Microsoft Sentinel (SIEM)

## üõ†Ô∏è Architecture: Before Hardening

In the **"Before"** phase:
- All VMs had open ports with unrestricted NSGs and no firewall rules.
- Key Vault and Storage Accounts were publicly accessible.
- Sentinel and Log Analytics were used to monitor this insecure setup.

## üîê Architecture: After Hardening

In the **"After"** phase, I applied hardening tactics based on NIST SP 800-53 SC-7(3):

- **NSGs**: All inbound/outbound traffic was blocked except from my public IP.
- **Private Endpoints**: Key Vault and Storage Account were made accessible only within the virtual network.

## ‚úÖ Summary

This project demonstrates how quickly vulnerable cloud resources are targeted and how applying NIST-aligned security controls dramatically reduces risk. Using Microsoft Sentinel and Defender for Cloud, I was able to monitor, detect, and respond to attacker behavior in real time ‚Äî reinforcing the importance of proactive cloud security engineering.
